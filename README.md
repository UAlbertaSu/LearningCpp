# LearningCpp

## This is a journal and repository for my journey in learning C++.

 - I would like to think that I have an advanced understanding of C **(C99)** but because I want to learn at least 1 new language a year (Thank you Dr. Ildar Akhmetov formerly at the University of Alberta) I have deicded that to help ease into graduation and this new habit, I would start with a language similar enough to a language I am already familiar with (C) but different enough that it requires thorough investigation to grasp (Object oriented Language vs low level C).
